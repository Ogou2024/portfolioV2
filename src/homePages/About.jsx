      <h2>My Story</h2>
      <p>I am an engineer, web developer, educator, polyglot, and an philanthropist.
      I grew up in Haiti, "Lapl√©n" - in a small town called "Karade" inside a small 
      village called "Gran Chimen". Mathematics and languages saved my life. 
      During my career experience, I have worked with top smart people at Google, Lockheed 
      Martin, and other major technology companies. Also, I have visited and lived in about 25 countries. 
      With this educational platform, I hope one day I can give back all the knowledge that I was given to my Haitian people.</p>
      <h2>My mission</h2>
      <p>A virtual choice for Haitians to have more access to web contents in their own language.</p>
      <h2>My Vision</h2>
      <p>To create sustainable, affordable, and easy access to online education for all future generations of 
      Haitians. I aspire to be a web educator in developing revolutionary techniques in teaching and learning 
      skills that improve education in Haiti.</p>
      <h2>My key goals</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><h3>Affordable, easy to navigate, and functional Websites</h3></li>
        <li><h3>Easy access to online Education</h3></li>
        <li><h3>Essential and Extraordinary online Contents</h3></li>
      </ul>
