            <h3>Electronic Circuit Design</h3>
            <p>Building electronic circuits is very fun and complex at the same time. At school, I had a lot of fun 
                analyzing and building and rebuilding those circuits.<br></br>
                <br></br>My advice â€“ Be patient! It will work.
