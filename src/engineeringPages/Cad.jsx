            <h3>Cad Work</h3>
            <p>I use cad a lot in my line of work. I learn very important skills through my experience. <br></br>
                <br></br>My advice â€“ make sure you have a programable mouse with many buttons as possible. Then 
                program the most useful commands that you use everyday if you do a lot of cad/drafting work.
