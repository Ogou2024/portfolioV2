            <p>
                Hayti has been called recently the republic of NGOs due the numbers of NGOs that are based there.
                Despite of having so many NGOs, the country still struggle to trully help the people. So Ouve Je w wants to assist in creating a bridge
                among those NGOs so they may work effectively and the same time helping our community directly. I am the 
                president and technical chief in the company responsible for the full-stack development tasks.
