            <p>
                There is a great need in my community when it comes to e-commerce. Tradisyon Lakay is a platform 
            that serve both the Haitian merchant and consumers. The site is built in Haitian language and has 
            capability to change to English and French and Spanish for Haitians living abroad. It is also 
            culturally based so it is built to Haitian community liking. <br></br>
            I am the founder and technical chief in the company responsible for the full-stack development tasks.
