            <h3>Haitian Language</h3>
            <p>First and foremost, I stop calling the language a creole simply because it is not. Today our 
                language is a language just like any other modern language in the world. The Haitian language is 
                spoken by more than 15 million people. Since 1987 it became the national language of Hayti. As of 
                today, it is being slowly implemented as the main language for education in the Haitian land.<br></br> 
                <br></br>I speak Haitian. Though this may sound weird to many people including some of my Haitians brothers 
                and sisters, but it is not weird for the Russians to say that they speak Russian, For the French to 
                say they speak French, and for the Portuguese to say they speak Portuguese.<br></br>
                <br></br>Listen!<br></br>
                Russians speak Russian <br></br>
                Haitians speak Haitian<br></br>
                <br></br>The vocabulary of the language is predominantly based off the French language but its soul which 
                are the grammar rules are based off the old African languages, more specifically of the old 
                language of the country of Benin today. Our language has evolved from being a pidgin, later to 
                creole, and now to the Haitian language. Our language History is unique but also in many ways it 
                has similarities to some of the modern languages such as French, Spanish, and Portuguese.<br></br>
                <br></br>Next time you decide to call our language, avoid using the word creole in there. We speak Haitian.
