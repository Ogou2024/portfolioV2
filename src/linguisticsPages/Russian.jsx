            <h3>Russian Language</h3>
            <p>Coming from the Haitian language where the subjects, verbs, and objects position are fixed in 
                all sentences. I had a lot of problem digest the Russian language format where their position is 
                fixed. The Russian language use something called “cases” to create their sentences. They have 6 
                cases. It is the cases that tell you if the noun is subject, object.<br></br> 
                <br></br>This was my biggest challenge in learning how to speak the Russian language. I did a thorough study of 
                the basic grammar rules. I also spent a lot of time coming up with various methods to get my brain used 
                to the flow of the language. Then, I applied my communicative approach skills to speak the language. 
                However, overall, I had a lot of fun. I was living in Ukraine at the time. I enjoyed every single day.<br></br> 
                <br></br>My advice – do not lose motivation if you are learning or want to learn Russian. Once you get over that 
                bump the language becomes easy to speak because the Russians are very logical people.
