            <h3>French Language</h3>
            <p>Growing up in Hayti, I learnt from very young age to read, write, and listening to French. I did not 
                speak French for most of my time in Hayti just like the 80 - 90% of the population. It was not until 
                I went to a very expensive school created for the upper class that I started to speak it fluently. I 
                was 16 years old by then.<br></br>
                <br></br>The fact that everyone at the school speaks French comfortably and fluently. In a period of one year, 
                I became fluent in the language as well. This is when the communicative approach idea came to me. 
                However, I did not think it was possible because I knew the language very well before that year.<br></br>
                <br></br>My advice â€“ do not get intimidated by the grammar rules and the pronunciation. Just learn the basic 
                grammar rules, before focusing on the communicative approach. The communicative approach is when you 
                focus solely on listening and speaking. Practicing listening can be done by listening to music, 
                podcasts, YouTube videos, movies, series, and news. Practicing speaking can be done by singing your 
                favorite songs and socializing with French speakers.
