            <h3>English Language</h3>
            <p>Given the right instruction, you can learn to speak English easily specially if you are from the 
                European languages. Now speaking English is very different from studying the English language. So, 
                reading and writing can be extremely very difficult. Again, given that you have the right 
                instructor, the learning process may be a bit easier.<br></br>
                <br></br>My advice is to approach the English language from a communicative approach. This means to practice 
                your listening through listen to music and podcast, watching movies and series with no subtitles of 
                your native language, practicing with English speakers. Also, you will need to practice your 
                speaking by singing your favorite songs, speaking to yourself in the shower, by socializing with 
                English speakers.
