            <h3>Portuguese Language</h3>
            <p>Off the start, I speak Brazilian Portuguese which is different from the actual Portuguese from 
                Portugal. I do not understand the Portuguese from Portugal. This may shock you a bit, even the 
                Brazilians do not understand the Portuguese from Portugal. The Portuguese in Brazil is spoken very 
                differently compare with the European Portuguese. There exists other Portuguese language in Africa, 
                and I understand those as well. I also can communicate with the Angolan and the people from 
                Mozambique and Cape Verde. </p>
