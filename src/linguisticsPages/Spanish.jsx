            <h3>Spanish Language</h3>
            <p>I have started to learn Spanish in my country - Hayti. But it was not until that I started 
                interacting with Spanish speakers in the United States that I really paid attention to the Spanish 
                language.<br></br> 
                <br></br>This is also when I started developing the communicative approach methods to learn a new language. 
                However, the communicative approach idea came to me during my last 2 years living in Hayti. I 
                learned to speak Spanish very by watching Mexican novella, singing the south, central, and 
                Caribbean Spanish music. I did watch a little bit of Colombian novella as well. Lastly, I got 
                deeply involved in Spanish speaker communities by socializing with them.<br></br>
                <br></br>My advice is to find a specific group to learn with in the beginning and then can learn also with 
                other groups. The Mexicans speak very slow and do not skip syllables. The Colombians and 
                Venezuelans speak very clearly but a bit faster than the Mexicans. However, they are all very 
                friendly and welcoming people.
