        <h1> Pontifícia Universidade Católica do Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil </h1>
        <p>PUCRS is one of the best private universities in Brazil and in Latin America as can be attested in 
          national and international higher education rankings. Also, it is located in Brazil which is one of 
          the most culturally diverse countries in Latin America and what we are today is the product of the 
          mixing between Amerindians, Africans and Europeans.</p>
        <p>The campus is located in Porto Alegre, capital of the southernmost state in Brazil, Rio Grande do Sul.
          Because of the size of the country, there is a variety of traditions, cultures, cuisine and attitudes 
          that make the state unique and particular in terms of lifestyle. <br />

        <p>During my study abroad, I took engineering classes in Portuguese where I have learned about power 
          machines and communication signal processing. I was also exposed to the vibrant culture of the country 
          which later benefit me in various factors of my life.</p>

            <li><p>It inspired me with new ideas and ways of thinking, which transformed both my personal and

            <li><p>The most important part of the experience was being able to learn about different cultures,
